This exercise is to create a method which checks whether 2 strings are an anagram or not. 
An anagram is a rearranged version of a word but has the same characters.  Ex. racecar and carecar are anagrams.

Steps to setup, create a static method called isAnagram() in the main file which takes two string parameters and returns a boolean.
static boolean isAnagram(String a, String b){
    //add code
}

Make sure to import the Arrays library.

Have fun!
